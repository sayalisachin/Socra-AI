# Socra-AI is about Learning using Socrates way of Teaching. The Project creates three pages - 
1. **Chat** - Generic Chat options for asking queries related with Data Structures
2. **Upload Code** - Uploads code and explains what the code does, asks questions in Socratic way to explain further
3. **Upload Quiz**  - Upload quiz question, the interface helps to solve the quiz in a Socratic way.

GenAI is the best solution since the dynamic nature of codes and quizzes can be handled efficiently.
The Socratic method requires asking open-ended, thought-provoking questions that guide learners to discover answers on their own. 
This process can vary widely based on the specific topic, the learner's knowledge level, & the context of the discussion. 
GenAI excels at generating contextually relevant, adaptive questions in real-time, adjusting its responses based on the input provided by the user. 
Learners may upload a wide range of contentâ€”such as code snippets, quizzes, or questions as needed.
